# Stock_Price_Prediction

I uploaded the dataset to a Google Colab after downloading it from Kaggle. After that, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis and looked for null values. Since there weren't any, I moved on to the data visualisation stage.LSTM are sensitive to the scale of the data. so we apply MinMax scaler. We also visualize the trends of the predictions and predicted the data for next 10 days and visualized that.
